# css library

TODO: add content and run+build details

## tech notes

Uses [lightningcss](https://lightningcss.dev/docs.html) (a parcel library) for the prod build, which doesn't have a `watch` command, but is _delightfully_ barebones, and I love that.

Uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for the dev build (HMR).
